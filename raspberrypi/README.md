## Project Status and Limitations

The Facial Tracking Rubber Band Launcher Robot is currently a working proof of concept. While the core functionality has been developed, the project is not fully complete to the standards we originally set due to time constraints.

Key limitations:
- Aiming precision and calibration working with facial tracking software.
- Automatic rubber band reloading has not been implemented.
- Hardware-software integration could be improved for complete operation as opposed to just proof of concept.

Despite these limitations, the facial tracking system is fully functional, successfully detecting and following faces in real time. The robot is capable of basic aiming and launching actions seperately, but it would have been good if the aiming was working with the faical tracking instead.

A video demonstration is included in this repository to showcase the facial tracking software and provide visual evidence of the concept in action.

We believe this project lays a solid foundation for future development and demonstrates the feasibility of our original concept.
